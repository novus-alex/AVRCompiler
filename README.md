# AVRCompiler
Compiler and Uploader for AVR microcontroller

## Setup
Works with java-11+ .
Be sure to use the correct java version

## How to use
First, you need to choose the correct port and microcontroller, then click "Upload", this button will open a file explorer window, choose your C/ASM file. Finally click open and that's all !

## Can't compile ?
Don't worry, i'm working on an update to automatically refresh the serial ports. But now, if you can't compile, just unplug your microcontroller and then connect it again.
